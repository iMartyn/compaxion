(Hack)Space Management System

So I'm being persuaded that we should create one of these.

I'm a firm beleiver of "eating your own dogfood" and we should have an API first and foremost.  Then a web front end and other front ends can be added to this such as native apps, widgets etc.

I'm pretty unsure about using a NoSQL database, but seen as I'm going to be doing a lot of MongoDB work soon I figured why not!
